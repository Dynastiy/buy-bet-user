        <p>Buybet is Nigeria's first betting exchange. Our online marketplace allows customers bet against themselves on football events. 

<br>Customers bet against each other not against
Buybet. 
<br>We're not a bookmaker, therefore we don't set or dictate the odds. You the customer decides everything. 

<br>For example, a match between Arsenal vs Chelsea, a customer is convinced Chelsea would win and place N1,000 on it. Another customer bets directly against it with the same amount of money. 

<br>Buybet works like an impartial middleman who holds the money when two people have an opposing view about a game. We simply give the total money to the winner after taking a little commission fee. 

<br>Buybet give you all the guidance you need, and
we encourage winners!

<br>Our event list contains bets from customers available to bet against. And if you want to bet against any of them or want your own to appear on the list for others to bet against, just send a WhatsApp message to our customer representative and your bet will be activated.
